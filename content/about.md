# Hey, I'm George

You can call me GP.

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com).

I enjoy growing my skills, and spend most of my free time learning new things. Right now I work on a team delivering Big Data platforms, solutions, and analytics; I use tools and ideas like Nspawn containers, Scala, Apache Spark, Kafka, Rust, continuous integration, reproducible builds, etc. Previously, I worked on a different team to help help deliver and publicly launch IBM's Next Generation Hybrid Cloud in it's first location, and then onwards to more than half a dozen more.

I use mostly Scala, Python, and Bash, but have dabbled in many of well known languages... and like to think I can pick up any required new one rather quick. Vim is my editor and IDE of choice ;)

I like spending my free time trying to crack passwords, playing around on TryHackMe or HackTheBox, or competing with my team [burner_herz0g](https://ctftime.org/team/63292) on capture the flag/cybersecurity events. Hopefully, will be able to add occasional Bug Bounty hunter to that list soon as well ;) I'd like to think I know at least a little about ML, but everyday I am amazed at how little I know in comparisons to some of my awesome colleagues (check out https://www.isaacleonard.com to see what I mean!)

I currently use everything themed by the beautiful [dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme.
