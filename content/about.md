# Hey, I'm George

Currently writing software at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com) (since graduating in '18).

When I'm not working, I'm either busy growing my skills (spending most of my free time focused on learning new things) or hanging out playing games (video, board, card). Right now I work on a team delivering Big Data platforms, solutions, and analytics; I've been working on creating and managing infrastructure and associated tooling to host highly available, mission critical software geared towards historical analysis of various Cloud platform services. Previously, I worked on a different team to help help deliver and publicly launch IBM's Next Generation Hybrid Cloud in it's first location, and then onwards to many more.

In my day-day, I do a lot of work in scripting languages (Python, Bash), but also write applications, which are usually in either Python, Scala, or Golang; In personal time, I enjoy using all those previously mentioned, along with currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I'd rate Python as my most used of all mentioned, but have dabbled in many of well known languages beyond those mentioned above... and like to think I can pick up any required new one rather quick. Vim is my editor and IDE of choice:)

In my personal learning time, I like spending most of it trying to crack passwords, playing around on TryHackMe or HackTheBox, or competing with my team [burner_herz0g](https://ctftime.org/team/63292) on capture the flag/cybersecurity events. I'd like to think I know at least a little about ML, but everyday I am amazed at how little I know in comparisons to some of my awesome colleagues (check out https://www.isaacleonard.com to see what I mean!)

Every year my colleagues and I take a week in August to work together on various events at the annual [Defcon](https://defcon.org/) conference. Our team has taken a step back this past year or so, so my contributions (and writeups) have stopped, but I'm making a concentrated effort to get back into things at the end of 2022. My personal favorite is participating in the "premier annual password cracking contest", [Crack Me If You Can](https://contest.korelogic.com/), put on by KoreLogic. I've played since 2020, and each year have learned and improved on the last one. Now if only someone wanted to give me a few dozen GPUs...

I implemented this website using a custom [dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme, but prefer using [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) for all IDE/development purposes.
