Nice to meet you; You can call me GP.

Currently I write software at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com).

I try to spend as much of my free time doing something productive, like
practicing a new programming language or reading up on industry best
practices.

If I'm not being productive, my preferred means of lounging is playing
video games; If a kind donor wanted to bestow me a new next gen graphics
card, I would not turn it down :).

## Work

I work on a team designing, building, and maintaining Big
Data platforms. These platforms are being used to deliver corporation
wide insights and analytics with direct executive management visibility.

My focus recently has been on the operationalization of the stack,
focusing more on building a shared library of sane, tested code and
scripts geared towards consistent building and delivery of all possible
service code.

Previously, I worked on a different team to help help deliver and
publicly launch IBM's Next Generation Hybrid Cloud in it's first
location, and then onwards to many more.

In my day-day, I do a lot of work in scripting languages (Python,
Bash), but also write applications, which are usually in either
Python, Scala, or Golang; In personal time, I enjoy using all those
previously mentioned, along with currently learning
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Python is by far my most used, but
I've at least dabbled in many well known languages beyond those
mentioned above... and like to think I can pick up any required new
one rather quick.

Neovim is my editor and IDE of choice.

## Fun

I enjoy trying to crack passwords (only recreationally, for educational
purposes), playing around on TryHackMe or HackTheBox, or competing
with my team [burner_herz0g](https://ctftime.org/team/63292) on
capture the flag/cybersecurity events.

## Defcon

Every year my colleagues and I take a week in August to work together
on various events at the annual [Defcon](https://defcon.org/)
conference. Our team has taken a step back this past year or so, so my
contributions (and writeups) have stopped, but I'm making a
concentrated effort to get back into things at the end of 2022.

My personal favorite is participating in the "premier annual password
cracking contest", [Crack Me If You Can](https://contest.korelogic.com/),
put on by KoreLogic. I've played since 2020, and each year have learned
and improved on the last one. Now if only someone wanted to give me a
few dozen GPUs...

## This site

I implemented this website using a custom [dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)
theme, but prefer using [Tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
or [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) for all
IDE/development purposes.
