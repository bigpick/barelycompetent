# Welcome, To Crypto World !!!!!

I wanted to do this separate than the rest of the b0ilers 2020 bootcamp CTF writeups, since this was pretty involved/large.

> Series of Mini Challenges made by @dm. There are two larger flags available if you exploit the website as well. Neither hidden challenge requires solving any of the minis. Those challenges are at the bottom of the challenge list - it is sorted by score.

When you connect to the service, we land in an interactive story/prompt:

{{< image src="/img/b01lers_bootcamp2020/world_home.png" alt="world_home.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}


You can navigate via the options in the top right, which allow you to move N/E/S/W to what I'll be calling "rooms".

After observing all the offered rooms, I present the lay of the land:

{{< image src="/img/b01lers_bootcamp2020/map.png" alt="map.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Forgive me for any misnamed rooms/topics, I'm not a crypto guy ;P (but I've tried to be as accurate as possible, as learning as we go here, folks)

Trying a problem reveals a statement that looks like needing to solve a system of congruences ("find x number that equals these numbers when modulo these numbers"), i.e [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/crt.html).

```python
from functools import reduce
def chinese_remainder(n, a):
    sum=0
    prod=reduce(lambda a, b: a*b, n)
    for n_i, a_i in zip(n,a):
        p=prod/n_i
        sum += a_i* mul_inv(p, n_i)*p
    return sum % prod
def mul_inv(a, b):
    b0= b
    x0, x1= 0,1
    if b== 1: return 1
    while a>1 :
        q = a// b
        a, b= b, a%b
        x0, x1=x1 -q *x0, x0
    if x1<0 : x1+= b0
    return x1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    modulos = xxxxx
    remainders = xxxxxxx
    print(chinese_remainder(modulos, remainders))
```


* **LEVEL 1: find a number that gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, a remainder of 6 when divided by 7, and a remainder of 9 when divided by 13**.

So from the above code, we will stub in:

```python
    modulos = [5, 7, 13]
    remainders = [2, 6, 9]
    print(chinese_remainder(modulos, remainders))
```

Running it, we get `412`.

```
> ans 412
CORRECT! Your flag is mini{G1_92e9a33c80ca7666c7f4b704}

LEVEL 2: find a number that gives a remainder of 616 when divided by 1277,
         a remainder of 1892 when divided by 3911, and a remainder of 3267
         when divided by 6833
```

Alright! On to the next one; same process, just updating our numbers.

```python
    modulos = [1277, 3911, 6833]
    remainders = [616, 1892, 3267]
    print(chinese_remainder(modulos, remainders))
```

Running this gives us `6429412122`.

```
> ans 6429412122
CORRECT! Your flag is mini{G2_9aa73c3f86221f07d9b789a9}

LEVEL 3: give the smallest positive x that satisfies x mod a_i = b_i, where

  a1 = 5485948154512337139220437723513046430670172804
  a2 = 2108813835706513804248871264701897235977426762
  a3 = 59351473308659155928757459746804856485
  a4 = 924847477382640006890848669912858050701990
  a5 = 12741718618862212680555500636008445150492416265

  b1 = 2661929484162718513247006741545910067104673680
  b2 = 1051667267149052195100488400753935294543177150
  b3 = 47216332074545827727316304129354717936
  b4 = 532886655965436047074701814450039258213526
  b5 = 11163090230050187304714123613300073905576382766
```

Again, success! This time, however, trying to run the above through the code given above results in a division/modulo by zero error. After a while, I decided to switch to using [gp](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/), which was successfull. The sequence to do so is:

Run the `chinese()` function against:

```parigp
Mod(2661929484162718513247006741545910067104673680, 5485948154512337139220437723513046430670172804)
```

And then repeated call it on the remaining constraints using the resulting values:


```parigp
Mod(1051667267149052195100488400753935294543177150, 2108813835706513804248871264701897235977426762)

```

All together in gp, it looks like:

```parigp

We can do this in `gp` again:

```parigp
? bezout(123, 179)
%1 = [-16, 11, 1]
```

which gives us:

```

LEVEL 2: find integers x and y that satisfy 5419637592*x + 8765372543*y = 1
```

OK, again:

```parigp

%2 = [784426129, -485011369, 1]

OK, so looks like this room is going to be tasking our ability to factor numbers.

There's _alot_ of ways to factor numbers out there, and some are **way** faster than others, so be sure to be careful on which you choose. For this, I usually use [FactorDB](http://factordb.com/) to check for simple values:

```python
# pip3.8 install factordb-pycli
from factordb.factordb import FactorDB

def check_factordb(N):
    factorized = FactorDB(N)
    factorized.connect()
    factor_list = factorized.get_factor_list()
    assert(len(factor_list) != 0 )
    return factor_list

check_factordb(xxxx)
```

However, for ones that aren't fully factored in there, we still need an alternative. Wouldn't ya know it, we can factor in Pari/GP too! (If you haven't caught on by now, it's pretty awesome.)

So for our first level (which is in FactorDB, but I'll demonstrate with gp anyways):

```parigp
? factor(48263)
%1 =
[ 17 2]

[167 1]
```

So:

```
> ans 17 17 167
CORRECT! Your flag is mini{I1_1a8ec6471c8824fff864a95c}

LEVEL 2: factor the number 8477969543906630921459041527576694. (E.g., for 12, you would answer 2 2 3)
```

Which we'll just ride the `factor()` train out this whole room:

```parigp
? factor(8477969543906630921459041527576694)
%2 =
[               2 1]
[               7 2]
[              13 1]
[              19 2]
[              79 1]
[             601 1]
[       234490397 1]
[1655726489421517 1]
```

so:

```

So for this, we need to be able to count primes between two numbers. This entails _actually knowing what numbers are prime_ and which aren't; Knowing so is much more difficult as number value increases, especially so if you are doing a naive division check for primality.

Pari/GP offers a few prime related functions; notable for this room are `isprime()` and `nextprime()`.

For the first level, we can just naively iterate over each number in the range and check if it is prime:

```parigp
start=1200
stop=1500
count=0
for(n=start,stop,n+=1; if (isprime(n), count+=1))
print(count)
```

Which when stored in a file (`count.gp`) and then ran via `gp count.gp`, we get `43`:

```
> ans 43
CORRECT! Your flag is mini{F1_c45a3e68b37e85ee427389c5}

LEVEL 2: how many primes are there between 123456780 and 234567890?
```

Sweet! Going again with the same exact file, but changing our start and stop values, we get `5852187` (ran in about 25 seconds on my laptop!)


```
> ans 5852187
CORRECT! Your flag is mini{F2_71724abed3c0a25e2f95393c}

LEVEL 3: what is the 16th prime number after 10^400?
```

Awesome! Now for this last one, we can make use of the `nextprime()` function, which does the following:

> Finds the smallest pseudoprime (see ispseudoprime) greater than or equal to x. x can be of any real type. Note that if x is a pseudoprime, this function returns x and not the smallest pseudoprime strictly larger than x. To rigorously prove that the result is prime, use isprime.

So, we can start at 10^400, and from there just continue on 15 more times (for a total of 16).

```parigp
x=nextprime(10^400); for(n=2,16,n+=0;x=nextprime(x+1);print(n,": ",x))
```

Which runs in about 2 seconds on my machine. The value it spits out for the 16th prime is:

```parigp
...
16: 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000018661
```

so plugging that in, we get the last flag of this level!

OK, so a basic base64 encoded string that was XOR'ed against a key that is a single byte. I'll use xortool to solve this, specifying the key length as 1, and since we're assumed to be working with English, I'll guess that the most frequent char is the letter `e`:

```bash
xortool -l 1 -c '\x65' output
1 possible key(s) of length 1:
'i
Found 1 plaintexts with 95%+ valid characters
See files filename-key.csv, filename-char_used-perc_valid.csv
```

OK, that sounds promising! Let's look:

```
cat xortool_out/0.out
The secret integer is twenty-five thousand, five hundred and twelve.
```

Sweet! We got our flag:

```
> ans 25512

LEVEL 2: the base64-encoded string below corresponds to XOR-encrypted
         text, with key length of 4 bytes. What is the integer in the
         message?

```

OK, so now we get an extra fold this time: the key length is now _4 bytes_ instead of just 1.

For this one, I just went with the brute force (`-b`) option of xortool, and then inspected the 100% validity results:

```bash
echo -n 'BfEIGiL6CAE+900cavdJAC6zCBkvv0wLJPBdACn6CBkj60BOOPZPBj76Rxs5v0EALvZPACvrQQEk

for hundopercent in $(cat xortool_out/filename-char_used-perc_valid.csv | grep ';100' | awk '{print $1}' | cut -d';' -f 1); do cat $hundopercent; done
```

Which yields:

Per the challenge description, the key length is unknown, and our task is finding the key that was used, and submitting it as a little-endian integer once found.

I tried various combinations of length and most expected character with `xortool`, but nothing seemed to yield any results. After some searching, I came across this pretty sweet tool, [Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey). I saved the above base64 info to a file, and ran accordingly:

```bash

separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to
the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,
laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce "

Doing some google searching, I found [this academic page](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mrh/330tutor/ch04s04.html) on Galois Fields in (2^m).

On that page, it mentions:

> Multiplication of binary polynomials can be implemented as simple bit-shift and XOR …

As well as shows a nice example.

Doing the same with 35 and 23, we get:

```

Enter: Z3, again! We can plug these values into a Z3 solver with our contraints:

* Must be non-zero
* "small" (NGL -- This was kind of a dick move, could have just specified with more precision this constraint, and not just "small")

With some guessing on how _small_ the values had to be, we get the following Z3 goodness:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from z3 import *
x = Int('x')
y = Int('y')
z = Int('z')
s = Solver()

s.add( (299*x) + (355*y) + (251*z) == 0 )
s.add(x!=0, y!=0, z!=0)
s.add(x<20, y<20, z<20)

print(s.check())
print(s.model())
```

Which when ran, gives us:

```
python solver.py
sat
[z = -7, y = -6, x = 13]
```

After submitting:

```

CORRECT! Your flag is mini{A1_27f3abda81e75486b9299fda}

         where a=69925405969, b=48507179354, c=32417688895
```

OK. After editing our Z3 code from above with the new a, b, and c values, and no size constraint, we get:

```
python solver.py
sat
[z = -69925405969, y = -69925405969, x = 80924868249]
```

Unfortunately, that's likely not "small", so we need to go back and now try to restrict our x/y/z size until we find something that the problem likes.

I tried first constraining x/y/z to be all less than `1000`, but after running for about 70 minutes, Z3 came back with `unsat` (i.e not possible).

So, I then bumped the constraints up to be `1000000`, and Z3 came back with an answer in a few seconds:

```python
python solver.py
sat
[z = -28381, y = -951115, x = 672945]

OK, so we need to find the square root over modulo 97 that equals to 88.

I did not have any time at all to look at this room, but it looks like it's solving a system of congruences, but with a fold where the value is now consistent of `x` and `y` that need to be solved for, in combination with the congruences.
