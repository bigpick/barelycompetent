Description: |
    Sometimes less is more. When you only want generated passphrases that maintain original apperance ordering, this is the tool you want. A massive keyspace generated by one of those other tools will contain these values, of course, but they also will have many, many, many other non-interested in outputs.

## phrasegen

Recently I'd talked a bit about creating all slices for a given input; This naturally
lends itself to generating well-ordered passphrases from a given input list.

I liked what it started looking like so much that I decided to clean it up and publish
it as a command line tool available to install via `pip` - you can find that packge here:
