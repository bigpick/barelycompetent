## Background

The docs for creating a Risk of Rain 2 modpack are mostly all contained on the
wiki, though they are not particularly well formed:

- https://thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/

The modding wiki, on the otherhand, has quite a bit of information, though I
found a lot of it to be outdated:

- https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki

### Results

Ultimately, the thing that matters is having a properly structured GitHub
repository, and then the key files and their contents.

Making a modpack is extremely easy after understanding the above - you basically
just need to make sure you have all your desired mods in the `manifest.json`.

Check out the end result!
